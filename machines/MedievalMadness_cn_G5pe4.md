## Tech Notes
            
The difficulty of Medieval Madness is determined by the sensitivity of the slingshots, the size of the post guarding the castle-lock and the consistency of the castle kickout to the left orbit. If all three of these are set generously, the game will play for a long time. The good news is that increasing the difficulty of any of these three, or all three in subtle degrees, will make Medieval Madness a good competition game. If changing the post guarding the castle-lock, the maximum difficulty used should be the standard yellow post. The larger-style tapered post is too difficult and will cause players to avoid the castle multiball entirely, which changes the strategy of the game in an undesirable way. (show picture of different posts installed on medieval) The castle kickout can be altered by adjusting the angle of the mechanism beneath the playfield. The more consistently the castle kickout rebounds off of the metal guide, the easier the setup. Because the castle sequence includes an uncontrollable shot to the lowered castle gate, and players will voluntarily put themselves in peril by shooting at it, directors are encouraged make the castle kickout as reasonable as possible and increase the game's difficulty in other ways.Installing thicker posts to guard the ramps will do little to lower the gametime in relation to the other issues previously discussed. It will, however, be an obvious bastardization and potentially upset players for little gain.As with altering the difficulty of all pinball machines, the slingshots will make more of a difference than any other adjustment. Begin by adjusting them prior to making any other changes.## Concerns
The catapult coil will become weak during extended play (12+ hours) and will cause the ball to return to the player via the left ramp, a significantly more dangerous feed than the standard catapult sequence. Any tournament with a steady qualifying line that lasts all day should upgrade this coil prior to the event or be prepared to address it at the players' request.

-   Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity
-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
-   Check Flipper Strength
