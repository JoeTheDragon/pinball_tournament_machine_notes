#### Tech Notes
            
Remove the rubber on the metal post at the top, center of the playfield. The ball will sometimes eject out of the upper right saucer, bounce off of this rubber, and fall back into the saucer. Some games have been known to repeat this process several times, leading to a tremendous scoring advantage.
