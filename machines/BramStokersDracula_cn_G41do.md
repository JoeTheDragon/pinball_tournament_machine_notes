## Tech Notes
            
Dracula is a game where rhythm is very important. Flipper hop on this game can be devastating to players, and it should be fixed or avoided at all cost. Turning off the ball-saver on Dracula will also turn off the ball saver during multiball. Considering the short ball times on this game at factory settings, and the fact the plunge and subsequent randomized pop bumper action are out of the playersï¿½ control, Directors are encouraged to leave the players a ball saver. If available, directors are encouraged to use the custom 500k mystery award rom.## Concerns
The mystery award is random and is significant enough in many situations to cause a competitive imbalance. Directors are encouraged to install modified roms that limit the mystery to 500k. Another potential fix is to lower the mystery timer to one second.
