#### Tech Notes
            
Director's are encouraged the keep the pitch of this game at or near factory recommendations.

#### Concerns
Locks can be stolen between players in a multiplayer match. Also, the flippers will noticeably weaken over time with extended play, meaning if the left ramp is not easily makeable at the start of a lengthy event, it will not be makeable at all by the end. Directors are encouraged to rebuild the flipper mechs and set the pitch of this game correctly prior to an event.

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack (see photo)
-   Verify Volume
-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Check Flipper Strength
-   Remove 1 ball, Install 2 balls only. Helps to balance lock stealing.
