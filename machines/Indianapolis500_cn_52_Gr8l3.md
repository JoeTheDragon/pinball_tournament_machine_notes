#### Concerns
            
Indy 500 has a software bug that sometimes surfaces when the turbo isnï¿½t loading balls correctly. When this software bug surfaces, it is possible to begin two multiballs at once, and it will also rarely give one additional ball saver to the affected player, which is deemed a beneficial malfunction. When this bug surfaces at PAPA, officials have allowed the current game to play out, though the game should be reset before another game is started.
