#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine -- about 1% steeper than factory recommendation
-   Playfield Panel Post Adjustment: HARD
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Check Flipper Strength, Consider Glo Balls if playing too slow or can't hit upper playfield
-   Ensure center eject is not easily exploitable; needs to be hard kickout. Use glo ball if needed.
-   Clean/wax playfield
-   Clean glass
