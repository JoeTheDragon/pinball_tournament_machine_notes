#### Concerns
            
Tap-passing on this era of Bally is crucial and Paragon is no exception. The tap pass should work well in both directions, but especially from the lower left flipper to the lower right. Some Paragon's have a plastic piece guarding the extra ball saucer at the end of the upper left orbit. If this plastic causes rejections from the saucer, Directors should consider removing it entirely.

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity
-   Check Flipper Strength
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
