#### Tech Notes
            
Consider the ball save at the beginning of the game is not the same as the ball save at the beginning of a multiball the former is given, the latter is an award that is earned as part of a multiball. Standard tournament setup for this game would be a default Crate multiball setup with a difficult Coffin multiball setup. Both multiballs would have short ball savers, but the initial plunge would not.

#### Concerns
Scared Stiff has no obvious tournament issues, though it can potentially be a long playing game depending on setup decisions.

# Scared Stiff
#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine slightly steeper than factory recommendation
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Remove rubber on movable outlane posts, but keep on post between inlane/outlane
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened. Fix if needed.
-   Check Flipper Strength
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Verify Volume
