#### Concerns
            
Skillful players will be capable of battling the genie for a significant amount of time. If the feed out of the pop bumpers is consistent and controllable, players will repeatedly shoot the left orbit and build Harem multiball to high levels, exposing a scoring imbalance and making the game extremely long playing and monotonous. Tales of the Arabian Nights is a good game in competition for Juniors banks or less skilled players, but it will be abused as the talent level increases and should not be used in any tournament where top-level players will have the opportunity to play it unless significant modifications are made.

#### Physical Setup
-   Verify Machine Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Make slingshots sensitive
-   Install Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened. Fix if needed.
-   Check Flipper Strength, verify ramps are hittable with ease
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Verify Volume
