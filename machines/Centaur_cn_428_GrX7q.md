#### Tech Notes
            
In general, Centaur is not a long-playing game, and the ball is out of control frequently by design, so there is little drawback to allowing players to nudge. Keeping the tilt reasonably loose will only encourage more strategizing within the game. If the rubber is still on the post guarding the gate in the outlane, and players are easily capable of putting a ball back into play, however, the game can, and will, play too long. Balance the tightness of the tilt with relation to this outlane post, erring on the side of allowing the players to nudge rather than tilt the game. Dipswitch 6 set to ON causes bonus X to carryover between balls Dipswitch 7 set to ON causes 20, 40, and 60 super bonus lights to carryover between balls Dipswitches 6 & 7 allow the player drastically different strategic opportunities depending on whether they are set to ON or OFF. Neither setting is considered 'correct', but if the game is used in a format where players are only permitted to play the game once, or with limited knowledge of how the game was playing for other players, Directors are encouraged to place a sign on the backglass explaining the settings. Dipswitch 30 controls the attract mode, puts unnecessary stress on the game, and should be set to OFF

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack (see photo)
-   Verify Volume
-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Check Flipper Strength

#### Multiball
The game features frequent multiball play including a lower lane multiball that can effectively act as an outlane ball save. Around 2024 some tournaments have started playing Centaur with only a single pinball. The game still performs the multiball launch light show but works correctly with only a single ball installed. This offers tournament directors an additional option for game setup.
