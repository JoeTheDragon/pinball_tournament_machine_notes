#### Concerns
            
Black Knight can potentially be a long playing game in a tournament environment with high-caliber players.

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine --factory recommendation
-   Outlane Posts on "Easy Settings". I.e. least open.
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Check Flipper Strength (after #43 setting below)
-   Clean playfield if necessary
-   Clean glass
-   Verify Volume
