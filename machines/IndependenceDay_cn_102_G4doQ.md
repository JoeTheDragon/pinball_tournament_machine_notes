#### Tech Notes
            
Do not set multiball difficulty to harder than factory. This will further encourage players to use the left lane strategy.

#### Concerns
Top playersï¿½ strategy is to shoot the left lane repeatedly for an award that builds to a large F-14 Hurry Up, resulting in very long play time. A gate in the top right allows balls shot along the top inner loop to come around repeatedly make sure this gate is working, or players will unfairly be able to get larger bonuses for shooting the top lanes and bumpers.
