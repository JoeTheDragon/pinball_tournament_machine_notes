#### Concerns
            
Ramp lock will occasionally release two balls instead of one, giving the player an unfair advantage of two balls on the playfield during single ball play.

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine, 1% steeper than factory recommendation
-   Outlane posts to Hard (most open) setting.
-   Make slingshots very sensitive
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Check flipper strength. Use Coil Adjustments if needed to strengthen.
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
-   Verify Volume
