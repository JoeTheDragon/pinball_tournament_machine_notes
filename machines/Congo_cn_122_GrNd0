#### Concerns
            
Congo suffers from the 3-switch, valid playfield software situation, but a true scoring exploit has not surfaced yet in any major competition. For the time being, Congo is considered fine for tournament play.

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity
-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
-   Check Flipper Strength
