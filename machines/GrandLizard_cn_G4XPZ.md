### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine, slightly steeper than factory recommendation
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   If possible, place a larger rubber on post adjacent to multiball lock shot.
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
-   Check Flipper Strength, ensure ball can easily go up ramps from stopped ball.
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Verify Volume
