#### Concerns
            
Expert players have been known to abuse the left orbit / ramp to the point of causing problems time-wise for tournaments. For this reason, Theatre of Magic is an acceptable choice for juniors or less-skilled divisions, but it is not an ideal choice for events where higher caliber players will receive repeated opportunities on the game.
