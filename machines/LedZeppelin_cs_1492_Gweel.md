#### Adjustments
- Left ball save difficulty: Hard
  - TD choice, but by default it is very easy to activate the left ball save and experienced player will have it nearly always active. The HARD setting means that the first ball save light is awarded after one completion of the two left standups. After that it takes 2 completions of the two left standups to light it again and it stays at this difficulty for the rest of the game.
