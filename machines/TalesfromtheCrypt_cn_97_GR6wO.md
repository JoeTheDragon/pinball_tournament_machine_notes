#### Tech Notes
            
Be sure the spinners are working well. The flipper coils on this game will become weaker with extended use due to heat. Be sure the cabinet has proper ventilation.

#### Concerns
Tales from the Crypt will be an average to longer playing game in a competitive environment. CPU code 3.03 fixes an issue where the video mode is worth excessive points. All directors are encouraged to update their software. The tombstone target is often a problem. The mechanism will fluctuate between being too sensitive and not registering clean hits because of flex in the target design.

An option is to install unofficial ROM 4.0 for better scoring and other fixes.
