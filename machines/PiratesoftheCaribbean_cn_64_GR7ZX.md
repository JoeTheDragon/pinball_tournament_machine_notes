This the Stern game
#### Concerns
            
Difficulty on Pirates of the Caribbean is determined, in addition to standard adjustments, by the Port Royal software setting (Feature Adjustment #3) and the return feed from the center ship. Disabling the post guarding the return feed from the ship will cause the ball to return in a far more dangerous, random manner. Directors are encouraged to utilize these two unusual adjustments as a last resort and rarely together.
