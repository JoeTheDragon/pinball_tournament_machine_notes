#### Tech Notes
            
Factory default settings generally should be fine, since the game plays quickly.

#### Concerns
Players tend to shoot for the ï¿½Spinner Millionsï¿½ feature above anything else, since it dominates the scoring. Consider making it more difficult to spin the spinner by using a weight, or (at an extreme) replacing the spinner with a switch that only registers once.
