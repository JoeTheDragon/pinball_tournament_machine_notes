#### Tech Notes
            
Be sure the flippers are strong enough to make all ramps easily prior to the tournament starting.

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Check if flippers go dead on coin door open. If yes, disable coin door switch.
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity
-   Check Flipper Strength
