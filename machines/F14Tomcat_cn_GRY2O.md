### Tech Notes
            
The kickback should be lit on F-14 at the start of every ball. If extra balls are disabled (normal for tournaments), then flight insurance doesn't function. So if extra balls are disabled, flight insurance must be as well, or it will tell you are insured when you are not. Increasing the slope and waxing the game is a good way to add challenge. Setting multiball to hard is the only other software setting that is normally in need of changing. If the game is brutal, there is no need to make it any harder. Tightening up the tilt to a degree will also increase challenge.

### Concerns
F-14 will be a fast-playing game in a competitive environment. Players will play for multiball and attempt to spot as many letters as possible on the right orbit.
