This is the Data East version.

#### Tech Notes
            
If Star Wars must be used, align the right flipper so that repeating the ramp on the fly is not possible. Make sure a ball exiting the scoop on the left does not bounce off of the left flipper when held upright back into the scoop.

#### Concerns
Star Wars is an extremely long playing game in a competitive environment. The center ramp is easily repeatable, awards large amounts of points, and spots Force awards which are also worth significant points. For these reasons, Star Wars is a poor competitive choice when using factory code. New code has been written that addresses some of these issues, but it is currently untested in competition. Greedo deserved it.

# Star Wars (Data East)
#### Physical Setup
-   Verify Machine Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Make slingshots sensitive
-   Install Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened. Fix if needed.
-   Check Flipper Strength, verify ramps are hittable with ease
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
