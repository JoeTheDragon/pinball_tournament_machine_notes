#### Tech Notes
            
No unusual adjustments are necessary. Manage difficulty through outlanes and slingshot sensitivity.

#### Concerns
If the game leans to the right and is set with no ball saver, players may complain when balls that are short-plunged drain down the right outlane. This is a very minor concern, however, since players retain multiple options off of the plunge and are in full control of how their ball begins. A very short ball saver can be added at the Director's discretion.

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity
-   Check coin door ball save.
-   Check Flipper Strength
