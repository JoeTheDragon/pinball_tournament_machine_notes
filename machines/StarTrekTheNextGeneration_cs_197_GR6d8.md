    Balls shot up the Delta Ramp that reach the diverter but don’t make it all the way to the Borg Lock
    can go down the wire ramp and trigger a lock. This usually happens when you have a steep
    playfield angle. If you don’t want this occurrence to trigger a lock you can disable it here.
    Available Settings:
    • N.F/LX-7 (default)
    LX-7 behavior. If Borg Lock is lit, Made-Left-Ramp switch triggers a lock.
    • FIXED
    If the Top Diverter wasn’t active and the ball goes down the wire ramp, the Made-Left-
    Ramp switch won’t trigger a lock.
