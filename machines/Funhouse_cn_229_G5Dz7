#### Tech Notes
            
Be certain the STEPS plunger is aligned correctly and does not rattle the ball off of the inlane opening. Check that the trap door does not cause a clean shot to airball over the switch.

#### Concerns
The gears in Rudy's head are very difficult to replace quickly, and one of them is difficult to find for sale anywhere. If using Funhouse, Directors should have a back-up plan in place or be prepared to deal with this issue should it arise. The difficulty of Funhouse is determined largely by the consistency of the scoop kickout to the right flipper. Because of the relatively short length of games on Funhouse at standard difficulty, Directors are encouraged to ensure the kickout can be either controlled by holding up the left flipper or dead-bounced from the right flipper to the left. If the kickout is inconsistent, the mechanism should be rebuilt. (show video of good and bad funhouse kickouts)

# Notes on Funhouse
#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity
-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
#### Gameplay Notes
-   A plunge where the first switch hit on initial ball launch goes to the right outlane will result in Rudy giving the ball back to the player and is normal and expected behavior
# Notes on Funhouse 2.0
-   If you want to enable the ability to switch the machine between 1.0 and 2.0, you need to go to:
  - Pricing -> Enable 1.0 -> Set to 1
