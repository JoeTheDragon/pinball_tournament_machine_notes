#### Tech Notes
            
Flipper hop on Flash Gordon should be fixed. Dip Switch #16 governs memory on bonus multipliers. Directors are encouraged to leave all posts in and make the tilt somewhat liberal. Players must be able to backhand the single drop target on the upper playfield with the lower right flipper, and ideally players should be able to shoot the plunger lane behind the drop target with either flipper, though the shot is typically much easier with the lower left flipper

#### Concerns
Flash Gordon is difficult, but it's a solid competition game. Prepare to receive complaints, and when you receive them, tell the players that Flash Gordon is awesome and they don't know what they're talking about, and if they complain anymore emperor Ming will crush their souls.

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine, per factory recommendation
-   Outlane Posts on Medium settings.
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened.
-   Check Flipper Strength, ensure ball can easily go up ramps from stopped ball.
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Verify Volume
