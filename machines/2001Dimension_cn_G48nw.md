### Tech Notes
            
Ensure flippers are strong enough to get the ball all the way to the saucers at the top of the machine, and the side kickers are strong enough to push the ball back into the drops and bumpers. Tilt should generally be loose, since 2001 is a �tilt ends game� mach###e.## Concerns
The ball count is only visible to the player in a small window in the lower left. Be careful that the ball-advance stepper is working 100%, or players may exploit and play a longer game than is allowed. There is no way to earn an extra ball in 2001.
