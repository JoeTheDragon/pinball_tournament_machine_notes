## Physical Setup
-   Level Machine -- about 1% steeper than factory recommendation
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity. If Tilt Ends Game, Note it on Backglass
-   Check Flipper Strength. Consider Glo-ball if flippers weak or play is too slow.
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
