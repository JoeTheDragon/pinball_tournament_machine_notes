## Concerns
            
The video mode can potentially be a safe way to earn lots of points in Doctor Who, meaning players who employ this strategy will take a very long time and generally not play much physical pinball to go along with the video modes. Unfortunately, there is no way to speed up or avoid the potentially repetitive video mode process. Advanced players may be capable of looping the side ramp with such ease that the game will play extremely long. Doctor Who is an acceptable choice for juniors or less-skilled divisions, but it is not an ideal choice for events where higher caliber players will receive repeated opportunities on the game.

## Physical Setup
-   Level Machine -- about factory recommendation
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Adjust slingshots to be extra sensitive
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Disable coin-door switch that kills flippers, if necessary
-   Check Flipper Strength
-   Clean playfield if necessary
-   Clean glass
-   Verify Volume
-   If possible, adjust return to upper left flipper to make looping ramp a more difficult shot than usual.
