### Tech Notes
            
World Cup Soccer requires only standard adjustments for competitive play. The kickback should be strong enough to send a ball hard off of the soccer ball. The left flipper should be strong enough to make the right ramp from a cradle.

### Concerns
Some Directors have argued the extra ball button lighting a jackpot should be disabled, but standard practice is to leave it functional. Directors should post a note on the backglass if the feature has been disabled.
