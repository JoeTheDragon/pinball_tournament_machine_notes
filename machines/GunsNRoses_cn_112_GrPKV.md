#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine, slightly steeper than factory recommendation
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened. Fix if needed.
-   After #34 adjustment, Check Flipper Strength, verify ramps are hittable with ease from stopped ball
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Verify Volume
