### Tech Notes
            
There is little room for a director to adjust the difficulty of the ramp shots. Difficulty is determined by sling sensitivity and outlane posts.### Concerns
Terminator 3 tends to play too long if left at factory difficulty.

### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine: 1% steeper than factory recommended
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. fully open position
-   Remove rubber from movable outlane post, keep it on post between inlane/outlane
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened. Fix if needed.
-   Check Flipper Strength, especially for hitting ramps
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Verify Volume
