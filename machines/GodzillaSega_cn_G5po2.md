### Tech Notes
            
The flippers will grow weaker with extended play during long qualifying sessions. Ensure the right ramp is easily makeable from a cradle on the lower-left flipper prior to the event starting. If the flipper struggles to make this ramp in any way while fresh, it will not be strong enough several hours into qualifying.

### Concerns
Godzilla can be a long-playing game if set too conservatively in a high-caliber event. The option to install lightning flippers is available, but only do so if your tournament involves extended qualifying with top-level players.
