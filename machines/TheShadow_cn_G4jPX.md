### Tech Notes
            
Directors are encouraged to leave the posts guarding the right ramp and start mode saucer at factory difficulty. Long game times on the Shadow are rarely a concern regardless of setup. Ensure all switches on the battlefield are working correctly.

### Concerns
2-way combo scoring from the left orbit to upper loop can create a scoring imbalance if easily repeatable. Most players are generally not capable of exploiting the imbalance, however, and many Shadows make this strategy difficult due to their inherent setup, slope, and speed, so the Shadow, regardless of 2-way combo scoring, remains a good game for all levels of competition.
