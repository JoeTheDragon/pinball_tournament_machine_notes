#### Carryover Jackpot
-   Power cycle the machine before each game to prevent the Burnout Multiball Combo Jackpot value from carrying over
  -   Without a power cycle this value can carry over in non-obvious ways from game to game, but the carry over is within each player position rather than shared across players.

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine, much steeper than factory recommendation
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
-   After #43 adjustment, Check Flipper Strength, ensure ramp is easily hittable from stopped ball.
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Verify Volume
