* Extra Balls are earned by hitting the entire center bank down while the Extra Ball light is flashing. The first opportunity to earn an Extra Ball happens on each ball when the player has earned about 25,000 points, and opportunities will continue to be offered to the player as their ball continues
* It is recommended to turn off Extra Balls and have them score 50K (via Self Test 16 and 17 set to ‘01’)
* There is both “Red” and “Blue” bonus on this game. If the Red Bonus earning opportunities are not nerfed, it creates a opportunity to run the multiplier up to 5x and backhand the right saucer for continuous 115k shots that are slow to collect, safe, and repetitive.
* There are no inlanes on the game, but there are one-way gates that allow a ball in the outlane to return to a flipper. If you feel that ball times are running too long for an event, you can:
** Remove one or both post rubbers in the outlane
** Remove the posts in the outlane
** Remove the one-way gates
