#### Tech Notes
            
When played at a higher skill level, Avengers degenerates into a one-shot game. Players will typically shoot the left orbit, LOKI, ad nauseam. Balls will frequently become stuck during multiball in a variety of places, most commonly around the Hulk figurine. In addition to the left orbit / ramp imbalance, a number of software issues also cause Avengers to be a poor competition choice for higher-skilled divisions.

#### Concerns
Care should be taken to avoid bounceouts from the lock that put a second ball into play when it shouldn't be there.

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine, much steeper than factory recommendation
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open. Remove rubbers from outlane posts.
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
-   After #43 adjustment, Check Flipper Strength, ensure ramp are easily hittable from stopped ball.
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Verify Volume
