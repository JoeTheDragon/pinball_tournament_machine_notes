## Physical Setup

-   Level Machine

-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.

-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack

-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump

-   Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened. Fix if needed.

-   Check Flipper Strength. If ramps are difficult, Substitute Glo Balls and see if it plays better.

    -   Alternate fix to hit ramps is to intentionally align flippers lower than normal.

-   Clean Playfield if necessary

-   Clean Glass

-   Verify Volume

## Adjustments:

-   Special award: POINTS.

-   Extra Ball Limit: NO EXTRA BALLS.
