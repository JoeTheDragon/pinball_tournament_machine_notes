# Notes on Funhouse
### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity
-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
### Gameplay Notes
-   A plunge where the first switch hit on initial ball launch goes to the right outlane will result in Rudy giving the ball back to the player and is normal and expected behavior
# Notes on Funhouse 2.0
-   If you want to enable the ability to switch the machine between 1.0 and 2.0, you need to go to:
  - Pricing -> Enable 1.0 -> Set to 1
