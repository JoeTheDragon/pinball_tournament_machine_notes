Strong shots to the Joker lock will sometimes bounce back into the playfield if the wire gate is not aligned correctly. If the game is leaning left, or the right orbit shot is easily caught on the left flipper, the batmobile hurry-up mode in the game can be exploited and create a scoring imbalance.

If the Joker lock lane is too clean, and the pitch is too shallow, a strong shot will occasionally move the entire way through the virtual lock and not register.

Centaur,Centaur,Bally,1981,,"In general, Centaur is not a long-playing game, and the ball is out of control frequently by design, so there is little drawback to allowing players to nudge. Keeping the tilt reasonably loose will only encourage more strategizing within the game. If the rubber is still on the post guarding the gate in the outlane, and players are easily capable of putting a ball back into play, however, the game can, and will, play too long. Balance the tightness of the tilt with relation to this outlane post, erring on the side of allowing the players to nudge rather than tilt the game. Dipswitch 6 set to ON causes bonus X to carryover between balls Dipswitch 7 set to ON causes 20, 40, and 60 super bonus lights to carryover between balls Dipswitches 6 & 7 allow the player drastically different strategic opportunities depending on whether they are set to ON or OFF. Neither setting is considered “correct”, but if the game is used in a format where players are only permitted to play the game once, or with limited knowledge of how the game was playing for other players, Directors are encouraged to place a sign on the backglass explaining the settings.

Later in the game after becoming “Pub Champion”, players are permitted to wager significant amounts of points in cash fights, leading to highly unusual and imbalanced situations in a competitive environment.

If aligned correctly, this adjustment will push the post farther into the orbit and give it a greater opportunity to divert the pinball.The inlane posts should not have any rubbers on them.

The good news is that increasing the difficulty of any of these three, or all three in subtle degrees, will make Medieval Madness a good competition game. If changing the post guarding the castle-lock, the maximum difficulty used should be the standard yellow post. The larger-style tapered post is too difficult and will cause players to avoid the castle multiball entirely, which changes the strategy of the game in an undesirable way. (show picture of different posts installed on medieval) The castle kickout can be altered by adjusting the angle of the mechanism beneath the playfield. The more consistently the castle kickout rebounds off of the metal guide, the easier the setup. Because the castle sequence includes an uncontrollable shot to the lowered castle gate, and players will voluntarily put themselves in peril by shooting at it, directors are encouraged make the castle kickout as reasonable as possible and increase the game’s difficulty in other ways.Installing thicker posts to guard the ramps will do little to lower the gametime in relation to the other issues previously discussed.
