## Tech Notes
            
Consider the ball save at the beginning of the game is not the same as the ball save at the beginning of a multiballthe former is given, the latter is an award that is earned as part of a multiball. Standard tournament setup for this game would be a default Crate multiball setup with a difficult Coffin multiball setup. Both multiballs would have short ball savers, but the initial plunge would not.## Concerns
            
Scared Stiff has no obvious tournament issues, though it can potentially be a long playing game depending on setup decisions.
