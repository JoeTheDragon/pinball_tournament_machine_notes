## Tech Notes
            
Demolition Man is prone to having clean ramps shots spin or “moonwalk” backward out of the inlane into the outlane, ending the player’s ball. This type of behavior can be avoided by laying thin strips of mylar on the ramp (or inlane if necessary) to alter the spin of the ball. A properly setup Demolition Man should never have balls moonwalk out of the inlane no matter how clean the playfield is.## Concerns
            
On standard settings, tournament players tend to repeatedly play multiball, choosing Lock Freeze. Disabling the claw via software forces players to vary their play and has met with success in multiple events. This is not a requirement, but a recommendation.
