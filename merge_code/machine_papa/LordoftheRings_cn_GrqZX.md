## Tech Notes
            
Many Lord of the Rings machines have trouble with the up-post in the rear of the machine diverting orbit shots into the Orthanc tower. This issue can be a problem in War of the Ents and other modes where right orbit shots are critical. The mechanism can be made more effective by adding a washer where it screws onto the bottom of the playfield and angling the post forward. If aligned correctly, this adjustment will push the post farther into the orbit and give it a greater opportunity to divert the pinball.The inlane posts should not have any rubbers on them. The fuse controlling the Ring magnet is frequently blown on this game. Directors are encouraged to check F20 to make sure it is working correctly (250v 4amp Slow Blow).## Concerns
            
Lord of the Rings will be a long playing game in a competitive environment unless it is set up correctly. If long gametime’s are a concern, focus on making the slingshots extremely sensitive and consider lowering the pitch to induce more lateral motion and making the ball more difficult to cradle.
