## Physical Setup
-   Level Machine -- about factory recommendation
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Adjust slingshots to be extra sensitive
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Disable coin-door switch that kills flippers, if necessary
-   Check Flipper Strength
-   Clean playfield if necessary
-   Clean glass
-   Verify Volume
-   If possible, adjust return to upper left flipper to make looping ramp a more difficult shot than usual.
