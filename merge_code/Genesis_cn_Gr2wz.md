## Concerns
            
Be sure the vari-target is functioning properly. A clean shot from a cradled right flipper should be able to register the target at its maximum.

## Physical Setup
-   Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened. Fix if needed.
-   Check Flipper Strength. If ramps are difficult, Substitute Glo Balls and see if it plays better.
    -   Alternate fix to hit ramps is to intentionally align flippers lower than normal.
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
-   Clean Glass
-   Verify Volume
