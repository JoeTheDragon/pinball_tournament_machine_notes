## Tech Notes
            
Directors are encouraged to leave the center post in Terminator 2. Difficulty should be adjusted by widening outlanes and adjusting sling sensitivity.## Concerns
Terminator 2 software contains bugs that can potentially be devastating to a competitive game. Known bugs include: 255 drop target hits to multiball, and a multiball bug that may occur when a ball is locked with zero seconds left on the timer causing a string of odd behavior from the game.
