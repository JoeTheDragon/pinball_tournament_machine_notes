## Concerns
            
Keep the tilt reasonably loose. The game�s design encourages dangerous shots and nudging, so ball times are generally on the short side as long as the outlane posts are not set at their minimum. There is little reason to make this game �tilty� or more difficult than it already is.

## Physical Setup
-   Verify Machine Level Machine
-   Monger has sometimes had a flaky switch, check for proper operation
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Make slingshots sensitive
-   Install Ear Plug Tilt Hack
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
-   Check coin door ball save.
-   Check Flipper Strength (adjust #43 setting below if needed)
-   Clean/wax playfield if necessary
-   Clean glass
-   Verify Volume
