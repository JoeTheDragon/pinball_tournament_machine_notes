#### Competition Notes
* Make notes about special things that Tournament Directors should be aware of
  * What kind of pitch should the machine have?
  * Any physical changes that should be made to the machine?
  * Are there competition ROMs to be aware of?
  * Should you replace any pinballs with powerballs?
* Bullet points are a good format for quickly communicating notes
