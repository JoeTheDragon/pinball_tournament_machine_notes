### Tech Notes
            
Directorï¿½s are encouraged the keep the pitch of this game at or near factory recommendation##### Concerns
            
Locks can be stolen between players in a multiplayer match. Also, the flippers will noticeably weaken over time with extended play, meaning if the left ramp is not easily makeable at the start of a lengthy event, it will not be makeable at all by the end. Directors are encouraged to rebuild the flipper mechs and set the pitch of this game correctly prior to an event.
