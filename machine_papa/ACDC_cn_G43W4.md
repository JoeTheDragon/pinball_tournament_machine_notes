##Tech Notes
            
Manage difficulty through outlane posts and slingshot sensitivity. The flipper rubbers on the lower playfield have a tendency to come off or wear out with extended play. Be sure to label the wires or make a mental note as to which wire plugs onto which connector since they appear very similar when reassembling the unit.##Concerns
            
AC/DC tends to be a longer playing game in a competitive environment.
