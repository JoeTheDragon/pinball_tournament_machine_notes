### Tech Notes
            
BOZO letters should reset between players. Make short plunging as difficult as possible by using a harder spring, or by tightening the slingshots.

### Concerns
            
The valid playfield switch exploit can be used to award certain scoop awards that unbalance the scoring. In addition to unbalancing the scoring, this technique can also cause the game to take an extremely long time to complete. The worst offender of the the valid playfield scoop exploit is the North America mode, which is known to offer jackpots as high as 64 million per shot. Utilizing the exploit to this extreme level in a competition scenario is highly unlikely, though if the feed out of the scoop is consistent, 2 or 4 million per shot is not unreasonable for above-average players to achieve. Nevertheless, even while the exploit in question exists, it is difficult enough to achieve that Ripleyï¿½s Believe it or Not is still a fine tournament game for the vast majority of competitive pinball situations.
