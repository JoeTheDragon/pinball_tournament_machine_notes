### Tech Notes
            
This game should be set up without rubbers on the outlanes, which is how it shipped from the factory. The tilt should be set loose enough to allow for nudging, but it shouldn�t be so loose that players can overwork the whirlpool and receive endless letters. Four letters for each trip to the whirlpool is reasonable, with some falling short at three and some attaining fiv##### Concerns
            
Creature is a relatively poor game for competition because the random awards can occasionally cause severe imbalances between players. While one player may receive Left Ramp Millions from the snackbar, a very lucrative mode, another play may receive �Hot Pretzel�, which is essentially a big middle finger from the programmer Jeff Johnson to anyone who desperately needs points to save their tournament life. This same imbalance also exists during the multiball sequence when players are required to find the girl in one of three areas. For some players the girl may be in the first cavern they search, while for others she will remain hidden until the third. Unfortunately, there is nothing in currently available software revisions that can be done to fix these and other issues.
