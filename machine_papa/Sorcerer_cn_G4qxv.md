##Tech Notes
            
Directors are encouraged to install a yellow post on the lock-ramp and remove the outlane rubbers.##Concerns
            
Sorcerer can be an extremely long-playing game in any event that includes qualifying or repetitive play. Director’s are encouraged to guard the lock-ramp with a yellow post at a minimum and to avoid using Sorcerer if possible in any event that will give top-level players extended opportunities to play. If set difficult, using Sorcerer in finals or normal bracket tournaments is acceptable, but it still runs the risk of being a long-playing game. This game also contains lock stealing between players in a multiplayer game.
