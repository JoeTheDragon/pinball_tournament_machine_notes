### Tech Notes
            
Batman will be a long playing game in a competitive environment. The Batman toy will occasionally block the center ramp with its fist or cape if not installed correctly. The rear saucer is prone to rejecting strong shots from the left orbit if the gameï¿½s pitch is too shallow. Strong shots to the Joker lock will sometimes bounce back into the playfield if the wire gate is not aligned correctly. If the game is leaning left, or the right orbit shot is easily caught on the left flipper, the batmobile hurry-up mode in the game can be exploited and create a scoring imbalance. All directors are encouraged to update their code to 2.94. This software revision is a worthwhile and significant upgrade over the code that was shipped on many games from the factory. The Joker drop target and blue nub on the left side of the center ramp (Part # 626-5085-00) are not common parts. Directors are encouraged to have spares on han##### Concerns
            
Setting the Lucius insert (gadget upper playfield) to easy or extra easy could potentially encourage players in some situations to reach the wizard mode with little downside to the adjustment. Due to the potential of a hurry-up scoring exploit, it is critical Batman is level from left to right. If the Joker lock lane is too clean, and the pitch is too shallow, a strong shot will occasionally move the entire way through the virtual lock and not register. One solution to this problem is to not clean that specific area. The dirtier, slower lane will help to keep strong shots from passing through the virtual lock without registering.
