Install virtual locks. Removing outlane posts on this game is ill-advised. Use Rom Version 2.0H##Concerns
            
At higher skill levels, the ringmaster battle can last for an extended period of time. This issue is deep into the game, though, so is only a concern if the game is being used in a repetitive qualifying scenario where players can become very familiar with the shots and rebounds. The Ringmaster battle difficulty can also be set to 100k per hit as opposed to a million, lessening the impact of an extended battle and further balancing with other goals in the game.
