##Concerns
            
The video mode can potentially be a safe way to earn lots of points in Doctor Who, meaning players who employ this strategy will take a very long time and generally not play much physical pinball to go along with the video modes. Unfortunately, there is no way to speed up or avoid the potentially repetitive video mode process. Advanced players may be capable of looping the side ramp with such ease that the game will play extremely long. Doctor Who is an acceptable choice for juniors or less-skilled divisions, but it is not an ideal choice for events where higher caliber players will receive repeated opportunities on the game.
