### Tech Notes
            
No unusual adjustments are necessary. Manage difficulty through outlanes and slingshot sensitivity.### Concerns
            
If the game leans to the right and is set with no ball saver, players may complain when balls that are short-plunged drain down the right outlane. This is a very minor concern, however, since players retain multiple options off of the plunge and are in full control of how their ball begins. A very short ball saver can be added at the Directorï¿½s discretion.
