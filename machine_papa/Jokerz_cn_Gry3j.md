## Tech Notes
            
The ramp shots are critical during the “double your score” mode. Be sure the flippers are strong enough to make both easily.## Concerns
            
Inducing a ball search while cradling a ball on the flippers will cause the center ramp to cycle and become accessible, giving players the opportunity to safely repeat multiball without having to shoot the standup targets. Current PAPA rules state inducing a ball search in order to gain any type of benefit is illegal.
