## Concerns
            
Repetitive use of the central vertical up-kicker during multi-day events could potentially lead to issues. Directors are encouraged to double-check this mechanism to ensure it is working properly. The lost-mine kickout on the left side of the game does a great deal to determine the game’s difficulty. If this kickout is easily controllable, individual gametime could increase significantly. Notes on Roms: The LH-6 home ROM is not recommended, despite the small bugs it fixes, because the mode timer does not count down during animations, making the 5X playfield + multiball (or Bigfoot Hotfoot) even more lopsided than normal. The LH-5 ROM does not award bonus hold correctly.
