##Tech Notes
            
When played at a higher skill level, Avengers degenerates into a one-shot game. Players will typically shoot the left orbit, LOKI, ad nauseam. Balls will frequently become stuck during multiball in a variety of places, most commonly around the Hulk figurine. In addition to the left orbit / ramp imbalance, a number of software issues also cause Avengers to be a poor competition choice for higher-skilled divisions.##Concerns
            
Care should be taken to avoid bounceouts from the lock that put a second ball into play when it shouldn’t be there.
