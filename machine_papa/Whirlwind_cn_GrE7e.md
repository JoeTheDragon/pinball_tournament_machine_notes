### Tech Notes
            
Full plunges from the shooter lane should go smoothly around the upper loop to feed the upper flipper.

### Concerns
            
Some players may attempt to �ramp out� similar to how the ramp is abused in Earthshaker, though the shot in Whirlwind is slightly more difficult and less lucrative, meaning the strategy is less of a concern. The common objective in Whirlwind is multiball jackpots. Multiball is achieved by shooting stand-up targets placed around the playfield. On any game where the main strategy forces a player into an uncontrollable shot, such as these stand-up targets, there should be less emphasis on widening outlanes or making the game more difficult. Players are already putting themselves in peril every time they attempt to advance toward multiball. With extra balls turned on, Whirlwind can be a long-playing game, but in a tournament setup where only three balls are played, Directors are encouraged to leave the game reasonable with respect to outlanes and sling sensitivity. Even long-playing, three-ball games of Whirlwind in a competitive environment are typically shorter than many other DMD games. Directors should also consider rebuilding the upper right flipper mechanism (or even upgrading it to a 6209 coil) to ensure the jackpot ramp is consistently makeable. Increasing the effectiveness of the upper flipper will do little to increase game times, but it will certainly increase the potential for high scores and added excitement.
