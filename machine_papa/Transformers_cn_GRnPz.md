### Tech Notes
            
The Optimus Prime target has a tendency to not work correctly. Ensure it is working well prior to competition. Also, make sure autoplunged balls end up in the jets and not in the super-skillshot lane. If the autoplunge does not feed the pop bumpers at the start of multiball, the player cannot light jackpots until all balls have been kicked out.### Concerns
            
Transformers has a tendency to play too long in a tournament setting if left at or near factory difficulty.
