## Tech Notes
            
There isn’t much on TX-Sector that is adjustable, and that is fine. Directors are encouraged to leave the game somewhat close to factory settings. Even the best players in the world will not be able to abuse this game on a consistent basis.## Concerns
            
Tournament Directors should be aware the right outlane has an opening that can feed a ball back to the shooter lane during multiball. If a ball does become stuck in the shooter lane during multiball, rules state the player must treat it as a stuck ball and plunge it immediately so as not to gain an advantage. The large drop target guarding the left ramp is unique and directors are encouraged to have this spare part on hand. (insert picture of shooter lane opening and drop target)
