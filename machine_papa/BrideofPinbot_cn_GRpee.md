### Tech Notes
            
Software settings can be used to lower the percentages of the billion point award as well as the jackpot on the small wheel. A second tactic would be to raise the billion point shot to its highest frequency.### Concerns
            
Bride of Pinbot will be a long playing game in a competitive environment. Whether Bride of Pinbot is a usable competition game is determined by the software settings. If set to factory, players will shoot the left ramp repeatedly in hopes of achieving the billion-point award. The billion point award in this game is random and extremely unbalanced, and therefore very unfair in a competitive setting.
