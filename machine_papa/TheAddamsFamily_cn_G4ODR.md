### Tech Notes
            
The difficulty of Addams Family is primarily determined by the consistency of the chair and swamp kickouts, the style of posts guarding the electric chair, and whether or not the right ramp is makeable from either flipper. Players should be capable of dead-bouncing the electric chair kickout from the left flipper to the right, and the swamp kickout from the right flipper to the left. While both of these feeds should always be physically possible, whether or not these feeds are actually controllable in this manner is up to the tournament director to decide. Be sure to check ALL of the switches in front of the bookcase in switch test.

### Concerns
            
Thing Flips will need to be dialed in after any moving or leveling of the game. The locking mechanism can prevent players from earning skillshots in multiplayer games, which can create a competitive imbalance between the players involved. Players frequently �time out� the Power magnets in competitive play, causing severe slowdowns; consider disabling these magnets while informing the players of the change.
