##Tech Notes
            
If Kings of Right Target must be used, disconnect the standup on the far right side of the playfield and put a note on the backglass explaining the change to players.##Concerns
            
Kings of Steel will play extremely long and is not recommended for a competitive environment. The standup target on the right side of this playfield is worth far too many points. Players will do nothing but shoot this target repeatedly, and the better players will manage to roll the score display, some more than once.
