Ali is typically a fast-playing game without any major adjustments necessary. If the multipliers reset at the beginning of each ball, the game becomes fairly one dimensional. If the multipliers are set to carry over between balls, the players are generally forced to play more of the playfield and make more strategic decisions later in the game.
