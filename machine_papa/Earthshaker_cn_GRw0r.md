##Tech Notes
            
To reduce game times, tournament directors can introduce flipper hop by placing a small wad of tape underneath the left flipper rubber. This type of fix is far from ideal, but if Earthshaker must be used and the length of the games to be played is a genuine concern for the format or location, the flipper hop will usually help reduce ball time. Why are you about to use Earthshaker? Do you really want to watch someone shoot a ramp 300 straight times?##Concerns
            
Long playing game due to the center-ramp-all-day strategy. The center ramp feeds the left flipper for an easily repeatable shot. The main problem is the center ramp also awards “miles”. After a player reaches the End of the Road mode at 99 miles, the center ramp is then worth 250k points per shot, making it extremely lucrative and reasonably easy to attain for better players. Directors are encouraged to avoid using Earthshaker in any competition that requires extended qualifying.
