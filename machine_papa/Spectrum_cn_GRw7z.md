Spectrum suffers from a highly unusual competitive layout, causing games to last an exorbitant amount of time in a competitive environment when compared to other games from the same era. In addition to the playfield layout leading to exorbitant game times from average to expert players, potentially causing backups in tournament queueing systems or scheduling, Spectrum’s scoring strategies are obscure to new players, making it a poor choice for novice divisions as well. When all factors are considered, tournaments are encouraged to find a better option.
