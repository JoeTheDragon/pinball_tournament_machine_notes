Adjustments 08, 09, 10, and 11 govern the game’s ball savers. Adjustments 16 and 17 govern the difficulty of the multiballs. Directors should make decisions that are correct for their own style of event. Before making any adjustments, however, consider that the Coffin multiball is a controlled shot whereas the Crate multiball is not.
