### Concerns
            
Goldeneye will be a long-playing game in a competitive environment. The shootout stand-up on the lower-left portion of the playfield can be used to stack kickbacks. Since the �kickback� on this game is a magnet that catches the ball from both outlanes and down the middle, each one represents an extra ball. Players will build these kickbacks until they can play the more dangerous modes in the game with relative immunity. There is no software setting to disable the shootouts, so the shootout target must be disabled beneath the playfield. Also, be sure the setting �Right ramp feeds pops� is set to NO, otherwise the tank coil will take a beating. One alternative to disabling the shootout target is to disable the ball saver magnet instead, though this option has not yet been tested and software compensation may override its usefulness. By disabling the magnet instead of the target, the wizard mode is still theoretically possible to the player, though if you can manage to actually finish the pen mode, you are a better player than the rest of us. Actually, if you can finish the pen mode, make a video of it any send it to Ripley�s Believe it or Not. They will likely put you in their wax museum, which would be a fantastic way to promote pinball to the masses. Also, for the record, PAPA is hereby officially sanctioning the Ripley�s wax museum.
