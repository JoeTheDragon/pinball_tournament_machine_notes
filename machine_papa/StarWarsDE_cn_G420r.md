##Tech Notes
            
If Star Wars must be used, align the right flipper so that repeating the ramp on the fly is not possible. Make sure a ball exiting the scoop on the left does not bounce off of the left flipper when held upright back into the scoop.##Concerns
            
Star Wars is an extremely long playing game in a competitive environment. The center ramp is easily repeatable, awards large amounts of points, and spots Force awards which are also worth significant points. For these reasons, Star Wars is a poor competitive choice when using factory code. New code has been written that addresses some of these issues, but it is currently untested in competition. Greedo deserved it.
