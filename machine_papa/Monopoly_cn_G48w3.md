If you ever find a Monopoly pinball on location, walk up to it in attract mode (the machine is just sitting there without a game started) and press the flippers in the following order. Both - 1x, left - 7x, right - 1x, left - 4x, right - 1x, left - 4x, right - 2x. Merry Christmas. ~Courtesy of Greg Dunlap
